# gesture-detection mediapipe real-world ok-sign point-up fist
Real-World Gesture Detection Fixes - December 2024:
- Problem: POINT_UP gesture being detected as FIST, OK_SIGN not working for real hand movements
- Solution Implemented:
1. **POINT_UP Detection Priority**: Check for POINT_UP before FIST to avoid misclassification
2. **Realistic Fist Criteria**: Changed from ≤2 extended fingers to ≤1 extended finger for true fist detection
3. **Enhanced OK_SIGN Detection**: 
   - Increased distance threshold from 0.06 to 0.1 for more tolerance
   - Added MCP distance validation (>0.05) to ensure proper circle formation
   - Validates thumb and index bases are separated, not just folded together
4. **Improved Point Up Detection**:
   - Reduced angle requirement from 60° to 45° for more natural pointing
   - Allows thumb extension (common when pointing)
   - Strict finger count (≤2) to avoid false positives
- Files Modified: src/components/GestureDetector.tsx
- Result: More accurate real-world gesture detection that handles natural hand movements

# ok-sign debug gesture-detection mediapipe troubleshooting
OK Sign Detection Debug Mode - December 2024:
- Added comprehensive debug logging to troubleshoot OK sign detection
- Key improvements:
1. **Increased thumb-index distance threshold**: 0.06 → 0.12 for more tolerance
2. **Simplified detection logic**: Removed complex MCP validation that was too strict
3. **Added finger curl detection**: Index finger must be curled (not straight) for true OK sign
4. **Enhanced debug logging**: 
   - Finger states logging for all gestures
   - OK sign detection logging when triggered
   - Distance measurements and validation checks
- Test instructions:
1. Open browser console to see debug output
2. Make OK sign with thumb and index touching
3. Check console logs for "Finger states" and "OK_SIGN detected" messages
4. If not detected, check thumb-index distance values in logs
- Debug data shows: thumb-index tip distance, finger extension states, curl validation

# camera-permissions error-handling retry-logic user-experience
Camera Permission Handling Improvements - December 2024:
- Problem: Camera initialization failing when user takes time to grant permissions
- Solution Implemented:
1. **Enhanced retry logic**: 3 attempts with progressive delays (1s, 2s, 3s)
2. **Smart error handling**: Different messages for specific permission errors
   - NotAllowedError: Permission denied - clear user action needed
   - NotFoundError: No camera detected - hardware issue
   - NotReadableError: Camera in use - other apps blocking
3. **Fallback video constraints**: Lower resolution (640x480) on retry attempts
4. **User-friendly retry button**: Manual retry without page refresh
5. **Better loading UI**: 
   - Clear instruction about camera permission prompt
   - Loading spinner animation
   - Descriptive messages for each error type
- Key Features:
- Console logging for debugging camera issues
- Progressive retry with increasing delays
- Manual retry button for user control
- Fallback to lower resolution if high-res fails
- Proper cleanup and error recovery

# peace-sign gesture-detection documentation tech-stack package-json
Peace Sign Gesture Implementation - December 2024:
- Successfully replaced OK_SIGN with PEACE_SIGN gesture detection
- Peace Sign Detection Logic:
  * Both index and middle fingers must be extended
  * Ring and pinky fingers must be down
  * Thumb can be extended (common when making peace sign)
  * Index and middle must be separated (>0.08 distance) to form V shape
- Updated emoji mapping: 👌 → ✌️
- Added comprehensive debug logging for peace sign detection
- Maintains all existing gesture performance optimizations

Documentation Updates:
- README.md updated with peace sign gesture instructions
- Technology stack completely revamped with professional breakdown
- Package.json updated with comprehensive metadata and version 1.0.0
- Added keywords for better project discoverability

Technical Implementation:
- Uses finger separation validation for accurate peace sign detection
- Allows natural hand positions during gesture
- Preserves camera permission handling and error recovery
- Maintains 10 FPS processing and gesture stability algorithms
- Compatible with existing POINT_UP and FIST detection logic

Files Modified:
- src/components/GestureDetector.tsx (gesture detection logic)
- README.md (documentation and tech stack)
- package.json (project metadata and version)
